# Reflection Report: Multi-Agent vs. Single-Agent

The multi-agent approach in **NaiWatches** provides a significant advantage in **reliability and depth**. A single agent often tries to please the user immediately, leading to "lazy" recommendations or hallucinated ratings. In our collaborative workflow, the **Web Scout (Researcher)** is specifically tasked with finding truth, while the **Hype Checker (Critic)** acts as a skeptical filter. This "checks and balances" system ensures that the recommendations are not just relevant, but grounded in actual current trends and high ratings.

Furthermore, the **Supervisor/Orchestrator** model allows for a transparent "Thought Stream." Instead of a black box that spits out a result, the user sees the work being done—the vibe check, the data scouting, and the internal debate. This increases user trust and allows for "Human-in-the-loop" interventions (Approval/Rejection) at critical junctures, something a single-shot agent cannot easily facilitate without complex prompt engineering. By branding this as **NaiWatches**, we emphasize the watching (surveillance/monitoring) aspect of the agents working together on behalf of the user.
